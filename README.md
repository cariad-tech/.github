# CARIAD FOSS Navigator

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first, as it is our base for interaction. 

In this repository we offer general information for CARIAD's Open Source projects, like the aforementioned [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or further legal information.

# CARIAD FOSS Projects
Open Source emerged to play an important role in CARIAD products, now it's time to give back to the FOSS community. We contribute in FOSS projects and also open source our own software products here on GitHub.com/cariad-tech. 

## FEP SDK
This documentation covers all information about the Software Development Kit (SDK) which comes with the Functional Engineering Platform (FEP).

It combines the FEP SDK documentation, the FEP SDK Participant library documentation and the FEP SDK System library documentation. Links may refer to all three of those documentations.

FEP is a product familiy of software libraries and tools that enables the composition of a distributed system in an automotive context. The resulting FEP System consists of a collection of FEP Participants that are connected to each other based on automatic network discovery mechanisms.
